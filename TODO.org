* Raw ideas
** I want to use tcp/ip network to exchange information between client and server.
** I want tabbed qt interface
** I need storage for about 50000 pomodoros, may be sqlite?
** I want hooks, after, before pom/short break/long break starts/ends
** I want some ruby library to handle cli interface.
* Stuff to do:
** DONE Add license information
** DONE Copy socket client/server ruby examples from travel notebook
** TODO Create dull server/client that can exchange messages.
** TODO Register domain for this project
** TODO Create bug tracker for this project
* Done
